# Project Title

A simple small game based on Nintendo's IP, Pikmin.

## Description

The game is RNG-based, so it's based on chance, but you can win!

Click the left box to "gather" the item, or click a monster and get hurt. If you click 3 monsters, you lose. If you click 3 ship parts, you win. You can accrue more score by clicking the Pikmin Pellets that come up that are labeled with a 1 and a 5.

## Getting Started

A windows PC (It might work on mobile, but it wasn't overly developed for mobile devices)
Google Chrome (It may work in other browsers but I can't guarantee it)
